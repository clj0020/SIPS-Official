# Sports Injury Prevention Screening Application #

Welcome to my repository for the SIPS application. SIPS is an Android application designed to allow low income schools to monitor student athletes to highlight students with higher risk of potential injury such that coaches and administrators can act accordingly. Lower income schools do not typically have access to medical professionals that would handle such screening.

There will be a lot of information on the readme pages of the separate parts of the project that are linked below.
